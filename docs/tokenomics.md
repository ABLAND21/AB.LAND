## Overview

AB.LAND introduces the ABLAND token (ABL) as the native utility token powering the decentralized token launchpad ecosystem. The tokenomics are designed to create sustainable value accrual, incentivize platform growth, and ensure long-term ecosystem health.

### Token Specifications

- **Token Name**: ABLAND
- **Token Symbol**: ABL
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 ABL (1 Billion)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Blockchain**: AB Chain (EVM-compatible)
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20
- **Contract Address**: TBD (Post-deployment)

### Core Principles

1. **Utility-Driven**: Every token has clear utility within the ecosystem
2. **Deflationary**: Built-in burn mechanisms reduce supply over time
3. **Community-Centric**: Majority allocation to community and ecosystem growth
4. **Sustainable**: Long-term value creation through platform revenue
5. **Transparent**: All allocations and mechanisms are publicly verifiable

## ABLAND Token Utility

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. Platform Fees
- **Token Creation**: 50% discount when paying with ABL
- **Pool Creation**: Reduced fees for ABL holders
- **Trading Fees**: Fee rebates based on ABL holdings
- **Premium Features**: Access to advanced analytics and tools

#### 2. Staking Benefits
- **Fee Sharing**: Earn portion of platform revenue
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on platform upgrades and parameters
- **Priority Access**: Early access to new features and token launches
- **Enhanced Limits**: Higher transaction and creation limits

#### 3. Liquidity Mining
- **LP Rewards**: Earn ABL for providing liquidity
- **Volume Incentives**: Rewards for trading activity
- **Referral Program**: Earn ABL for bringing new users
- **Creator Rewards**: Bonus rewards for successful token creators

#### 4. Governance Participation
- **Proposal Creation**: Stake ABL to create governance proposals
- **Voting Power**: Voting weight proportional to staked ABL
- **Parameter Updates**: Vote on fee structures and platform parameters
- **Treasury Management**: Decide on treasury fund allocation

### Token Economics Formula

```
Token Value = (Platform Revenue × Revenue Share %) / Circulating Supply

Where:
- Platform Revenue = Sum of all platform fees and services
- Revenue Share % = Percentage distributed to token holders
- Circulating Supply = Total Supply - Burned Tokens - Locked Tokens
```
